# Doma Documentation

This repository manages the English version of the [Doma](https://github.com/domaframework/doma) documentation.
Localization into Japanese is managed through [the Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/doma-docs).

We welcome contributions to improve both the English and Japanese versions.
